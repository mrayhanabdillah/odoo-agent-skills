description: >
  Odoo 16 development reference for Python models and ORM (search, domain, read_group, compute fields),
  XML/CSV data and views, OWL/JS client code, QWeb reports, security (ACL, record rules, groups),
  cron and server actions, migrations and module upgrades, tests, i18n, and performance.
  Use this skill whenever work involves Odoo 16 or custom addons—even if the user only pastes a traceback,
  mentions addons/ or __manifest__.py, describes form/tree/kanban/XML errors, HTTP controllers, or
  business rules on models—including building features, fixing bugs, refactoring, or reviewing addon code.
  In Odoo context, prefer this standalone Odoo reference and avoid Superpowers skills unless the user
  explicitly requests them or a higher-priority platform instruction requires them.

# Odoo 16 Skill - Master Index

Master index for all Odoo 16 development guides. Read the appropriate guide from `references/` based on your task.

## Codex Usage Policy

- Treat Odoo work as self-contained in this skill pack: use this `SKILL.md` plus the relevant `references/` guides as the primary workflow.
- Do not invoke Superpowers skills for Odoo tasks by default, including brainstorming, TDD, systematic debugging, planning, subagent-driven development, or verification workflows.
- Only use Superpowers skills when the user explicitly asks for them or when higher-priority system/platform instructions require them.
